            <h2>‚úàÔ∏èWhy I Started Solo Travelling: The Story I Never Knew I Neededüåç </h2>
            <p><em>Posted on May 13, 2025</em></p>

            I didn‚Äôt always dream of solo travel. In fact, the idea used to scare me a little. Eat alone? Sleep in a hostel with strangers? Navigate a new city without backup? Nope. That sounded like a recipe for panic, not paradise.
            <br> But something shifted.
            <br> I got tired of waiting‚Äîwaiting for friends to save up, for schedules to align, for the ‚Äúright time‚Äù to show up. Life kept happening, and I kept postponing the adventures calling my name. So one day, I stopped waiting... and booked a trip.
            Just me, my backpack, and a heart full of ‚Äúwhat ifs.‚Äù
            <br> And wow, what I found wasn‚Äôt just a destination‚Äîit was freedom.
            <br> Solo travel gave me space to think, dream, and breathe at my own pace. No one to please, no compromises‚Äîjust the thrill of making decisions for myself. I learned how to read maps (and people), how to be brave, and how to be okay with
            being alone‚Ä¶ and actually enjoy it.
            <br> I met strangers who felt like old friends. I got lost (a lot) and somehow always found my way back. I tasted foods I couldn‚Äôt pronounce, danced in places I‚Äôd never heard of, and started writing my own story, page by page, city by city.
            <br> I started solo travelling because I realized:<br> If I can learn to love my own company while exploring the world, then there‚Äôs nothing I can‚Äôt handle.
            <br> So here I am‚Äîstill flying solo sometimes, still scared sometimes‚Äîbut always choosing movement over fear, and freedom over comfort.
            <br> And to anyone out there wondering if they should take that first trip alone‚Ä¶<br> Do it. Your future self will thank you.
